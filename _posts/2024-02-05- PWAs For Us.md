# Update: WebGL and then Progressive Web Applications 

*__Last post said:__*
"To make games more accessible I'm now using Unity's WebGL platform option to create and distribute games. For those of us that push their Roombas around with a broomstick, like I do &#128512;, WebGL technology enables us to make games you can play in your desktop and phone internet browser. ...More to come."

## The "More to come" involves extending our WebGL Game apps into Progressive Web Apps  

PWAs (progressive web apps) are apps that can run, and be installed, on most web browsers.<br><br>
 **In our case, on this site:** 
- PWAs are WebGL games you can play in your web browser
- You can optionally install PWA apps/games to your desktop or phone - then you can play even when your device is offline - not connected to the internet
- Google, Apple, etc. playstores are not required to distribute PWAs - and PWAs can run just as well as playstore apps
- To learn more about PWAs and their benefits please go ahead do your own bit of research 

## Here's a PWA-based Arcade "Sphere Interception" Game: 

It's our first proof of concept. It plays well online - and offline. You can play on the web and/or follow a simple prompt to install it and play it offline.

<div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center; width: 100%;">
    <a href="https://bobkoto.github.io/bob-site/az" style="display:flex; height:100; width:100%; justify-content:center; align-items:center" 
    title="Intercept the Spheres. Click to play...">

             style="height:50; width:50%; justify-content:center; align-items:center" 
             alt="A sphere intercept arcade game"> 
    </a>

**Android users:** When installing a progressive web app to your mobile device Google may "offer" to scan or examine the PWA app. Is this Google really just being nice and helpful - or is Google snooping or otherwise trying to collect our info, data, whatever? 

This site's content and games have nothing to do with Google. The browser in use when Google "offered" to scan the PWA being downloaded was not Google's (Chrome) browser. It happened to be Samsung's web browser. If it happens accept or decline Google's "offer" at your own discretion.

All that said, unless specifically stated up front this site will never include apps that require any unnecessary permissions, collect your data/info, contain ads, etc. And open source code for all games, and for this site, are public on GitHub.

**IOS/Apple users:** This site's PWAs are not yet tested on **IOS** web browser(s). You're certainly free to try.

More PWAs are on their way...

*Please enjoy, and limit your play time. Take more walks.*
