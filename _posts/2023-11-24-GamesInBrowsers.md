# Games In Browsers

To make games more accessible I'm now using Unity's WebGL platform option to create and distribute games. For those of us that push their Roombas around with a broomstick, like I do &#128512;, WebGL technology enables us to make games you can play in your desktop and phone internet browser.
<br><br>
Find WebGL games you can play right now in your desktop or phone browser here: [Game Lab](https://bobkoto.github.io/bob-site/gamelab).
<br><br>
 More to come.
<br><br>
In the meantime here's a haiku by G Petey (Chat GPT):
<br>
Prompt: write a haiku about gaining knowledge.
<br><br>
 Silent minds unfold,<br>
 Wisdom's petals softly bloom,<br>
 Learning whispers truth.   - G Petey
<br><br>

If there isn't one already maybe there should be like a CC-1 license for these GPT things so we can all enjoy more red tape...
