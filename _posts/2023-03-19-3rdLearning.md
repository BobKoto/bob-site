When I get this to work I'll let you know how ChatGPT worked out as my co-worker...

So far my results with ChatGPT are mixed - about 50% helpful answers to my queries. Maybe the answers ChatGPT give you are on a par with the quality of the questions you ask. There are many dimensions to ChatGPT and I'm only commenting on my little journey with this github pages site buid.


Better than a lot of actual people I've worked with. At this point my advice is trust but verify & test!
