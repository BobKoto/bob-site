# Some notes on my use of ChatGPT to help me with creating this website: 

There are many dimensions to ChatGPT and how you can use it. Here I address only ChatGPT helping me 
with building this website, in particular:

- using Jekyll themes here on Github.io
- coding some HTML
- coding some Javascript
- using Markdown

Having never looked at nor studied any of the above, with ChatGPTs help and Github tutorials I got this messy experiment,
including the Game Gallery and the images and videos it serves out,
up and running in about 3 weeks working on it for a couple hours a day. 
Full disclosure: I am a middling programmer with C# and a bit of Java under my belt.

So far my results with ChatGPT are mixed - about 50% helpful answers to my queries. Mostly syntax or code snippet questions.
Maybe the answers ChatGPT give you are on a par with the quality of the questions you ask. 
IMO: Way way better faster and more immediately useful than what I ever got from Goog or DuckDuck!

My advice is trust but verify & test!

# Many people seem to be concerned that AI like ChatGPT might become or is already sentient.

Well, maybe it is doing so, but not for the best? 

I haven't observed this firsthand (been using ChatGPT for a few weeks) but I have seen claims that ChatGPT hallucinates. 
Human beings hallucinate. In fact some pursue hallucinations via drugs or whatever -
(astral projection anyone?).

And if you surf the web or read newspapers you'll see reports that ChatGPT emits biased info answers or whatever.
So do people, and probably more often than ChatGPT does.

ChatGPT is a human creation that often with ingenious software written by ingenious humans ingeniously reflects back what has been created by humans.
