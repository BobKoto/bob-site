## Games in beta:

Pinball: (aka touchinput1 converted from and Android platform to WebGL) Playable. Laggy input response and minor screen resolution issues. Still kinda fun and chill.

<br><br>
CubeTest: Just test of on screen juystick for mobile. For desktops WASD and arrow keys will move player. Otherwise does very little. If you're very bored you can play and maneuver through the hoops.
