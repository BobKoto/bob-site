## Games in development that you can play:

# No ads or anything - just games to play and enjoy

Illusion Pinball: aka touchinput1 ported from Android to WebGL so you can play in your browser. 
<br>Note: The newer your mobile phone the better the game should play for you. If your phone is older than 3 or 4 years (as of December 2023) you may experience laggy input/flipper response. Most lap/desktops should play ok.<br> A relaxingly easy pinball game with some odd video and audio illusions. Kinda fun and chill. Enjoy...

Immaculate Interception: Just a casual arcade kinda game to see how fast you can intercept the onrushing spheres. It may not look like it but the game always runs with the very same pattern of sphere motion and direction... The more you play it the more you'll see the pattern! But will you ever master it and finish in about 10 or 15 seconds? Or is that even possible?
