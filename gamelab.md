## Games in beta:

Pinball: (aka touchinput1 converted from and Android platform to WebGL) Note: Game is playable. The newer your mobile probably the better. Older mobiles may have laggy input (flipper) response. Decent lap/desktops should play ok, too. A relaxingly easy pinball game with some odd video and audio illusions. Kinda fun and chill.

CubeTest: Just test of on screen joystick for mobile. For desktops WASD and arrow keys will move player. Otherwise does very little. If you're very bored you can play and maneuver through the hoops. Maybe we'll add some "trancy" background audio.
