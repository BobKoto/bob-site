## Games in beta:

Pinball: (aka touchinput1 converted from and Android platform to WebGL) Playable. Laggy input response and minor screen resolution issues. Still kinda fun and chill.

<br><br>
CubeTest: Just test of on screen juystick for mobile. For desktops WASD and arrow keys will move player. Otherwise does very little. Maneuver through the hoops.
