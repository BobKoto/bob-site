This site has 2 purposes:

1. Share screen shots of games and other open source software I have done and am currently creating. Providing examples to help anyone doing 3D games in Unity on mobiles. 

2. Share some fun or meaningful and interesting quotes. 

3. (future) Maybe share completed games. For now anyone using Unity can clone my projects.

I started this site from scratch around the 3rd week of March 2023. It was on a todo pile for some time. 

A few weeks ago I promised to email screen shots of my work to someone very dear to me. I thought it 
would be better to stop procrastinating, get this humble site online, and instead of swamping her email with 
a bunch of image attachments just send her a link to this site. &#128512; Now I can share it with even more people.

I will surely put more content here that bots, scrapers, SEO overlords, etc. will not care about...

And then, because I never know when to quit, there will be even more. So check in every couple weeks, months, years, or whatever. 
I will see about getting RSS/Notifications working to update you as content is added.
