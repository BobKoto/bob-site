This site has 2 purposes:

1. Share screen shots of games and other open source software I have done and am currently creating. Providing examples to help anyone doing 3D games in Unity on mobiles. 

2. Share some funny or meaningful and interesting quotes. 

3. (future) Maybe share downloadable ready to play games. Until then anyone using Unity and is interested can clone my Android projects on Github.

I started this site from scratch around the 3rd week of March 2023. It was on a todo pile for some time. 

A few weeks ago I promised someone dear to me that I would email her screen shots of my work. I thought it 
would be better to stop procrastinating, get this humble site online, and instead of swamping her email with 
a bunch of image attachments just send her a link to this site. &#128512; 

Now I can share it with even more people.

More content to come here that bots, scrapers, SEO overlords, etc. will not care about...

I am considering RSS/Notifications to let you know when content is updated.
Until then check in every couple weeks, months, years, or whatever.
