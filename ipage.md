# *Purpose:*

## *1. Share games and other open source software I have done and currently creating. This includes:*
- native Android,     
- WEbGL,
- and PWA (Progressive Web App) game apps.  
- (all mostly developed in Unity)

The WebGL and PWA games on this site are playable. No ads, no permissions, no data collection, no nonsense - just games to share. The PWA(s) can also be installed on your PC or mobile device and run offline. For those interested all the games/projects on this site are available on GitHub - links provided. Especially providing examples to help anyone developing casual games mostly in Unity. PWA app framework is the going forward standard for games/apps that will be put on this site.   

## *2. Share some funny or meaningful and interesting quotes.*
*Any content provided by our pal G Petey (ChatGPT) is marked accordingly.*

&#128512;A while ago I promised someone dear to me that I would email her screen shots of my work. I thought it 
would be better to stop procrastinating, get this humble site online, and instead of swamping her email with 
a bunch of image attachments just send her a link to this site. &#128512; 

I am considering RSS/Notifications to let you know when content is updated.
Until then check in every couple weeks, months, years, or whatever.
