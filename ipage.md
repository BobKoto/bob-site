This site has 2 purposes:

1. Share screen shots of games and other open source software I have done and am currently creating. Providing examples to help anyone doing 3D games in Unity on mobiles. 

2. Share some fun or meaningful and interesting quotes. 

3. (future) Maybe share completed games. For now anyone using Unity can clone my projects.

I started this site from scratch around the 3rd week of March 2023. It's been on a todo pile for some time. 

After I promised a few weeks ago to email screen shots of my work to someone very dear to me I thought it 
would be better to stop procrastinating, get this humble site online, and not swamp her email with 
a bunch of image attachments. And of course share it with more people, FWIW.

There will surely be more that bots, scrapers, SEO overlords, etc. will not care about...

And then there will be even more, so check in every couple weeks, moths, years, or whatever.
