I created this simple, easy to play, Android based pinball in Unity and C#.
It's so easy and relaxing to play maybe I should have called it Chillusion. &#128512; 


Gameplay is physics based. To make it more fun and interesting I included auditory (best with ear phones) and optical illusions.

On ball in play 2, the game surface looks like this:

![Ball2 image](assets/IllusionPinball2.jpg){: width="75%" height="75%"} <br>
"Ball 2 playing surface and yes there is an illusion..."

On ball in play 3, the game surface looks like this:

![Ball3 image](assets/IllusionPinball3.jpg){: width="75%" height="75%"} <br>
"Ball 3 playing surface and yes there is more obviously an illusion..." And did that guy just turn into a basket of fruit?

Note: As code goes it could be way better and neater. That said, I play tested this on a mid-range Android phone - Galaxy J7.
I consistently played for an hour or more with little drain on the battery and only (sometimes, after an hour or so) the physics 
getting "flaky" and sending the ball out of play. Probably easy to fix - but I moved on.
