## Showcase a la Metaverse:
Big props, and thanks to the people at Croquet.io for WebShowcase, &#128512; 

![WebShowcase image](assets/wscase01.jpg){: width="75%" height="75%"} <br><br>
Go to the [Showcase](https://bobkoto.github.io/bob-site/webshowcase) and cruise around a web metaverse. Maybe you'll find me or someone else - in there. 

### The best part of web showcase can be just moving around webshowcase-land.
...and see some opportunities. Another best part is it works with mobiles and desktops, like everybodyelse's. Right?

## About this showcase kinda prototype (expect to change often, I think): So far we have:

- some images of games 
- a video 
- a link to somewhere else 

Just basic "stuff"
