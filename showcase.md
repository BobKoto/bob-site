## Showcase a la Metaverse:
Big props, and thanks for WebShowcase, to the people at Croquet.io &#128512; 

## Here is a web showcase kinda prototype (expect to change often, I think). So far we have:

- some images of games 
- a video 
- a link to somewhere else 

Just basic "stuff"

### But the best part is just moving around webshowcase-land.
...and see some opportunities. The best part is it works with mobiles and desktops, like everybodyelse's. Right?

Go to the [Showcase](https://bobkoto.github.io/bob-site/webshowcase)

Before or after you go get a quick inspiration from the lucky kongas...
