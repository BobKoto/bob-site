Go to the [Showcase](https://bobkoto.github.io/bob-site/webshowcase) and cruise around a little metaverse (courtesy of Croquet.io) set up for and by this site. Maybe you'll find me or someone else - in there. Note: started 1/24, will change a lot at first. You might find some quick videos and games to play in your browser. 

### The best part of web showcase can be just moving around the 3D webshowcase-land.
...and see some opportunities. Another best part is it works with mobiles and desktops, like everybodyelse's. Right?

# About this showcase kinda prototype (expect to change often): So far we have:

- images of games 
- a video  
- links to games playable in your browser 
- a PDF file 

Just basic "stuff"

# Big props, & thanks to the people at Croquet.io for WebShowcase, &#128512; <br>
