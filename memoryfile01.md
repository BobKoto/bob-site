# Tech Notes: 
A casual memory and reflex challenge game for Android created with Java using Android SDK.

Gameplay uses player screen taps to replicate a random sequence of 6 symbols and their associated auditory tones, randomly produced by the game, with scoring depending on how fast the player can repeat the random sequence.

I play tested this on a mid-range Android phones- Galaxy J7 - and phones as old as Galaxy S4,
often playing for an hour or more with little drain on the battery.
