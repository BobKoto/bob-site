## *Everything on a website is a placeholder for something better, right?*

### The PWA  [PWA lab](https://bobkoto.github.io/bob-site/pwalab) has games anyone can play or download to their browser. No ads or anything, just games you can enjoy for absolutely free. The "download" part is what a PWA is/does.

### The WebGL [Game Lab](https://bobkoto.github.io/bob-site/gamelab) has games anyone can play right now in their browser. No ads or anything, just games you can enjoy for absolutely free.

### The [Showcase](https://bobkoto.github.io/bob-site/showcase) is a mini metaverse where you can see some pics, WEBGL games, and invite others and voice chat... well, just check it out. Courtesy of Croquet.io. Maybe interesting multiplayer things to come.
