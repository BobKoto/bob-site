### This site is under construction but feel free to look around. All links should work, and more to come. 
Main purpose is to share screen shots and video clips of open source games (Android based for now) I have created 
and am developing, and maintaining on Github. 

And, secondarily to share with you some thoughts in posts, and interesting and maybe sometimes amusing quotes.

I started this site from scratch around the 3rd week of March 2023. It's been on a todo pile for some time. 

After I promised a few weeks ago to email screen shots of my work to someone very dear to me I thought it 
would be better to stop procrastinating, get this humble site online, and not swamp her email with 
a bunch of image attachments. 

And of course share it with more people, FWIW.
